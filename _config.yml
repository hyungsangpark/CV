  Hi, my name is Hyungsang Park. I'm a Software Engineering Student in my final year. 
  My area of interests are frontend and mobile development. 
  I have experiences in web development with React and TypeScript, and in mobile development with React Native and both iOS and Android native development environment. 
  
  Other than development, I am interested in learning new languages, listening to a variety of music, presentation software, and talking with good people in a cafe after a nice meal. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>React</mark> and <mark>learning different languages</mark>

          CodeRacer enables users to practise the code syntax and familiarise themselves with the frequently used algorithms by typing a block of code in a timed manner. The game supports single player and multiplayer up to 5 players. This project uses <mark>TypeScript</mark>-based MERN stack (<mark>MongoDB</mark>, <mark>Express</mark>, <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Node.js</mark>) and is hosted on Heroku. It was developed by a group of 5 students, and I participated in the development of UI and frontend as well as some <mark>CI/CD</mark> managements.

          I started this project as a way to learn <mark>Swift</mark> and <mark>SwiftUI</mark> for iOS native mobile
          development. What also motivated me was because I was receiving a lot of rides from my friends, 
          and this would be a fun app to turn it on and quantitatively measure the price of the ride. (Of course, with
          an intention to compensate them back ðŸ˜‰) It uses location services to track the speed of the ride and 
          accumulates rides accordingly to the price specification of Korean taxi price regulations.

          This was a project developed as part of Microsoft Student Accelerator NZ program. 
          I had to develop a full-stack web application that uses <mark>TypeScript React</mark> and <mark>C# .NET</mark> with <mark>GraphQL</mark> as API library. The application is hosted on Azure Web Apps. This application allows you to upload QT texts (short for Quiet Time, a contemplation on a short piece of scripture) and share them with your friends. It uses ESV Bible API to retrieve the scripture texts.

          I was part of the application team which developed Sylo Mobile application. We used React Native and TypeScript
          to develop a cross-platform mobile application. Some of the tasks I've participated in my internship were 
          solving missing NFT issues, implementing the ability to send multiple medias in chat, and fixing issues on 
          Android devices regarding permissions and multiple concurrent video instances. 
          
          An achievement I've made during this internship is updating the frontend codebase set-up documentation and 
          assisting fellow interns in their set up process. As a result, set up time was dramatically decreased down to 
          20% of previous years.
